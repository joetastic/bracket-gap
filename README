So far I've only comitted the straight JS files to prevent confusion between what's phonegap and what's the actual app.

This probably should be restructured so its easy to build either an iphone app or an android app from the same sources.


TODO:
  A couple of the unit tests need to be updated (not a lot though)
  I think the tournament lib needs to be beefed up to support unbalanced brackets
  A legitimate contact manager needs to be added to the first screen.

Please do not expect this to work out of the box.  I'm publishing early since I havent had time to tighten it up.
